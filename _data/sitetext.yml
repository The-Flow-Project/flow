    title: "The Flow"
    text: "From Deep-Learning to Digital Analysis and their Role in the Humanities Creating, Evaluating, and Critiquing Workflows for Historical Corpora"
    body: "Historical research increasingly makes use of digitization, benefiting from advancements in Handwritten Text Recognition and Natural Language Processing. This is where The Flow comes in and aims to promote the use of digital methods by developing a workflow that can be used by historians without expertise in information science and coding.
    

    The Flow, running from 2023 to 2026, strives to create standardized digital workflows using existing  technology, facilitating easier digital work with premodern historical sources.


    The Flow is a joint project of the DH departments of the Universities of Bern and Bielefeld and the Research Centre for Hanse and Baltic History in Lübeck. The project is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) and the German Research Foundation (DFG)."

    title: "Sub-Projects"
    text: "Four subprojects contribute to the project’s overall goal by analysing legal and administrative sources spanning different periods and regions, including England (13-15th centuries), the northern European Hanse area (14th-17th centuries), Switzerland (16-18th centuries), and Ethiopia (19th century).
    
    
    The sources will be studied with digital methods, namely the use of (newly created) Handwritten Text Recognition and Natural Language Processing models for historical languages. Through a praxeological and institutional framework, our project tackles complex research questions surrounding societal processes, the practice of law, and its impact on everyday life."
