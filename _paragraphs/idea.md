Historical research increasingly makes use of digitization, benefiting from advancements in Handwritten Text Recognition and Natural Language Processing. This is where *The Flow* comes in and aims to promote the use of digital methods by developing a workflow that can be used by historians without expertise in information science and coding.


*The Flow*, running from 2023 to 2026, strives to create standardized digital workflows using existing  technology, facilitating easier digital work with premodern historical sources.


*The Flow* is a joint project of the DH departments of the Universities of Bern and Bielefeld and the Research Centre for Hanse and Baltic History in LÃ¼beck. The project is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) and the German Research Foundation (DFG).
