Vivien has been a research assistant at the FGHO since 2021. Since her studies, her focus has been on Hanse history and digital methods of source cataloguing. At the Research Centre, she is in charge of the Citizen Science-project "Hanse.Quellen.Lesen / Read.Hanse.Sources" and has mainly worked on 16th and 17th century manuscripts. With this project, she aims to establish Citizen Science more firmly in (digital) historical research.
