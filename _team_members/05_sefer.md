Sefer has been part of The Flow since September 2024. After working extensively with Ottoman legal sources in different phases of his academic journey, he is now developing a novel perspective on the study of Ottoman legal historiography. As part of “The Flow” project, Sefer uses digital tools and machine learning to analyze Arabic & Ottoman Turkish records (sijills) of the Shari‘a courts of Ottoman Jerusalem. He ultimately aims to deepen his interdisciplinary knowledge, believing that integrating multiple disciplines will help him better understand the institutional framework of Ottoman Jerusalem and its complex historical, legal, social, and cultural dynamics.
