Angela leads the Research Centre for Hanse and Baltic History at the European Hansemuseum in Lübeck. Her research has long focused on the history of the German Hanse. With the Lübeck sub-project, she hopes to be able to provide other (Hanseatic) historians with digital tools and methods for their work.
