Inga is in charge of the Lübeck sub-project on *The Flow*. During her studies, she already worked extensively with manuscript sources from the pre-modern period. In the project, she is interested in analysing the Hanserezesse in detail as one of the most important sources of Hanse history. By using digital methods, she hopes to conduct a long-term study on the development of the German Hanse for the first time.
