Dominic is part of *The Flow* since July 2023. In his PhD project he works with the Bernese Tower Books (interrogation protocols from the early modern period). He employs various machine learning applications for handwritten text recognition, information extraction and document clustering. Simultaneously, he theorises the epistemological consequences of conducting historical research based on data generated by machines and humans alike.
