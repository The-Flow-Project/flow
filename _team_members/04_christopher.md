Christopher has been part of *The Flow* since July 2023 with the aim to pursue his PhD in it. His main research focus is on ‚essoins‘ - excuses for not appearing in court in English common law. He analyses court rolls of the 13th and 14th centuries with a focus on group influences and affiliations, as well as intersectionality, using customised HTR and NLP models.
