The sub-project focuses on questions of categorization of different cases brought to trial (and, in most cases, involving “peinliche Befragung,” that is, torture) in the tower of Bern. The project inquires if, from a textual perspective, frequency and type of delinquency can be contextualized, leading to insight into the inner workings of the legal system of one of the major city-states north of the Alps. The corpus-level perspective is deliberately chosen in order to avoid modern categorizations and to bring into focus instead the commonalities of single cases recorded in the tower books. This perspective takes discussions of alterity seriously that ask for an understanding of pre-modern pasts that is not biased by modern language. At the same time, it is coupled with recent approaches to the linguistic analysis of written documents.


Technically, we will, after an initial phase involving text recognition, focus on large-scale comparison of single cases. The tower books will be made accessible in full-text, and by topic occurrence via adapting existing methods. Topic modeling and comparisons of vectorized text parts (understood as an NLP task), in particular, have so far only infrequently been used for pre-modern textual data that has not been normalized. The labeling of similar cases, yielding categorization, will be based on the close reading of single, “typical” (statistically determined) cases. This will show which cases are highly correlated, and thus could potentially involve similar offenses based on what accusations were brought.
