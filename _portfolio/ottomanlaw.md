This sub-project focuses on the records (sijills) of the Shari‘a courts of Ottoman Jerusalem. These records, spanning about three centuries, constitute a major corpus of sources for the legal history of the Ottoman periphery. The sub-project analyses criminal cases, particularly those based on customary law, contributing to the debate on how law was understood and applied by various actors (judges, litigants, court officials) and how the Ottoman Sultan intervened in the lawmaking process. It also explores what law can reveal about social practices in contexts considered marginal to the central domains of the Ottoman Empire, especially the Arab province of Palestine, and contributes to the development of machine-learning-based workflows for sources in Arabic and Ottoman Turkish.


The project will construct a data set for the judicial corpora of Ottoman Jerusalem. Based on this data set, it will explore whether the frequency of particular kinds of cases or features of cases can be contextualized, providing insights into the underlying dynamics of Jerusalem's pluralistic legal system. After an initial phase, in which text recognition using HTR models for the Arabic and Ottoman Turkish script used in the sijills is developed, the project will focus on the large-scale comparison of single criminal cases using NLP tools. This will advance our knowledge of a lesser-known chapter of Jerusalem's legal history, offering us a glimpse of the transformation of judicial practices, and their complex interactions with social reality, over an extended period.
