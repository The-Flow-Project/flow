The project carried out at the Research Centre for Hanse and Baltic History (FGHO) in Lübeck delves into the extensive sources on the inner workings of the German Hanse, a voluntary association of merchants and towns shaping economic and political landscapes for centuries. The hanserecesse, spanning from 1358 to 1669, document the common voluntary decision making of towns located in the vast area from today‘s Netherlands to Estonia. These records covering about three centuries form the central source corpora on the history and development of the German Hanse. 


Within The Flow, we examine the recesse with the help of digital applications and thus present a long-term study of the development of the German Hanse for the first time. Next to this study, we are working on the creation of suitable HTR and NER models for Low German manuscripts in order for other research to have easier to access the extensive source material of Hanse towns and their collaboration.
