The team at Bielefeld University is particularly interested in analysing the court rolls of the early English Common Law. There are two main aspects to the sub-project: 1. Digitization of different types of court rolls of the 13th and 14th centuries using HTR and OCR models; 2. Analysis of the specific role of essoins within the Common Law focusing on the impact of social categorization on legal procedure using NLP tools.


As part of the FLOW project, Bielefeld will contribute ground truth data to improve the language models used in HTR procedures for the Anglicana script used in the court rolls. We evaluate existing tools and standards for medieval HTR to make it easier for historians to integrate digital methods into their workflow.


On the basis of this, the Bielefeld team will try to enhance the output of NLP tools for the detection of named entities and employ this technology in the analysis of the social relations and structures imminent at court. A special focus will lie on questions of intersectionality and group formation as it is present in the court proceedings.
